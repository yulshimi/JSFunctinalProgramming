# JSFunctinalProgramming
Implemented the lazy evaluation by delaying evaluating an expression until it was forced(lazy.js). 
Made the expression evaluated instantly from the second time by caching the evaluated result when it was forced for the first time.
Qucik sort is implemented with functional programming in quick.js.
